RAxML Bipartition Computation: Drawing support values from trees in file RAxML_bootstrap.Hymenoptera_Phylogeny onto tree in file RAxML_bestTree.Hymenoptera_Phylogeny_best


RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -p 12345 -f b -m PROTGAMMAAUTO -t RAxML_bestTree.Hymenoptera_Phylogeny_best -z RAxML_bootstrap.Hymenoptera_Phylogeny -n Hymenoptera_Phylogeny_bipartitions 




Found 1 tree in File RAxML_bestTree.Hymenoptera_Phylogeny_best



Found 1000 trees in File RAxML_bootstrap.Hymenoptera_Phylogeny
